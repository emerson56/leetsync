# LeetCode
This year, I wanted to keep my data structures and algorithms skills sharp. So, I set up this repository to keep track of the problems I solved and take advantage of GitHub activity tracker. 

To make my job easier, I'm using a Chrome extension created by [LeetPush](https://github.com/husamahmud/LeetPush). It makes the job of pushing my code to GitHub easy; well it's done automatically. I can focus on solving problems on the Leetcode platform.
